NAVAL_VESSEL_CONDITION_BASED_MONITORING
This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting the gas turbine decay state coefficient in naval vessels using regression analysis. The dataset used for this analysis includes various features related to the performance of gas turbines. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes features necessary for predicting the gas turbine decay state coefficient. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate regression analysis.
